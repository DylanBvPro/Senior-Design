# TEAM CONTRACT

## Project Overview

Our team will pursue the following initiatives, based on interest, feasibility, and partnership confirmation:

### Game Development
We will develop a modification for an existing real-time strategy (RTS) game—or create a new RTS title—that integrates adaptive artificial intelligence. The AI will:
- Use machine learning to analyze and counter player strategies over time, or
- Apply rule-based or heuristic logic to respond dynamically to environmental changes and player behavior.

## Team Commitments
Regardless of the chosen project, each team member agrees to:
- Collaborate actively through regular standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives
- Communicate transparently about progress, blockers, and feedback
- Respect timelines and deliverables as defined in our shared roadmap
- Contribute equitably to both technical and non-technical aspects
- Document thoroughly to ensure maintainability and knowledge sharing
- Adapt and iterate based on testing, feedback, and evolving project needs

## Early Professional Experience

My senior design project centers on developing a software solution or original creative product that embodies modern principles of computer science and software engineering. This capstone showcases planning, architecture, and execution skills developed at the University of Cincinnati and through internships/co-ops in software engineering, web development, and research.

I have combined theoretical learning with hands-on development in areas including software methodologies, quality assurance, embedded systems, and full-stack engineering. Relevant coursework includes (but is not limited to):

- CS-2011-20: Introduction to Computer Systems
- CS-2023-20: Python Programming
- CS-2028C-20: Data Structures
- CS-2071-20: Discrete Computational Structures
- IT-2030C-18: Information Security and Assurance
- IS-2080C-22: Digital Technologies for Business
- CS-3003-20: Programming Languages
- EECE-3093C-20: Software Engineering
- CS-4033-20: Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Applications
- EECE-4029-20: Operating Systems & Systems Programming
- CS-4065-20: Computer Networks and Networked Computing
- CS-4092-20: Database Design and Development
- CS-4071-20: Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- CS-5168-20: Parallel Computing
- EECE-5132-20: Software Testing and Quality Assurance
- CS-5167-20: User Interface I
- CS-5170-20: The Theory of Formal Languages and Automata

### Professional Roles
- Endpoint Support (≈6–7 months): Provided IT support, troubleshooting hardware/software/network issues, managed service requests, and supported faculty/staff/students.
- Research & Development Co-op, ATech Training (≈7–8 months): Researched cost-effective alternatives, expanded product catalog, developed embedded systems and microcontroller boards (Embedded C, ATMega, Eagle).
- Web Developer Co-op, Siemens Digital Industries Software (5 months): Modernized legacy systems, designed a new interactive training application, worked with Mendix and explored Astro; focused on full-stack and UX improvements.
- Software Engineer Intern, Nationwide Financial (4 months): Contributed to replacing a legacy system; wrote JUnit tests, supported front-end and back-end modernization, gained experience with AngularJS, TypeScript, and testing frameworks.

## Project Motivation

- Game development route: Aligns with background in game modding and interest in storytelling, world-building, and interactive design. Goal: produce a fully playable, polished RTS with adaptive AI and ideally publish on itch.io or Steam.

## Note on Public Publishing

Materials published on GitHub may differ from versions submitted for academic evaluation. For privacy and security reasons, some elements may be modified, redacted, or removed to comply with data protection best practices and future platform or organizational requirements. If the project advances to public or commercial release, additional adjustments may be required to meet company policies and security protocols.
