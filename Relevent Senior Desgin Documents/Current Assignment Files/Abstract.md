# Abstract

This project examines the complete development cycle of a video game, from initial concept through potential publication. It addresses both technical and creative requirements—prototyping, playtesting, debugging, and deployment—with an emphasis on rapid feedback and iterative design to refine gameplay and user experience.

The work demonstrates sustained effort and adaptability on a long-term, evolving challenge, integrating unfamiliar frameworks and design principles into the workflow as they are encountered. By prioritizing feedback loops, usability testing, and agile practices, the project illustrates how responsiveness and iteration lead to a more polished final product.

Ultimately, the project highlights the complexity of game development and showcases the developer’s capacity for persistence, creativity, and self-directed learning over an extended period.
