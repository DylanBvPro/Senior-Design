# Possible Constraints of My Senior Design Project

Every project, regardless of scope or ambition, is shaped by its constraints. My senior design project is no exception. As I move from concept to execution, I’ve identified several key challenges—professional, legal, and security-related—that will influence both the development process and the final product. This document outlines those concerns and reflects on how they may shape the trajectory of my work.

## Professional Expectations

One of the most immediate challenges involves professional expectations, particularly in the areas of presentation, adherence to standards, and broader development requirements.

- Presentation: A visually engaging and intuitive interface can elevate a project’s impact, but this is an area where I lack experience. My limited background in visual design and modeling may result in longer development cycles or underwhelming aesthetics. Bridging this gap will require additional learning and iteration.
- Standards: The compressed timeline of a senior design project means that certain development phases—such as testing, documentation, and refinement—must be accelerated. This can lead to compromises in quality, especially when compared to the rigorous benchmarks expected in professional software and game development. I hold myself to a high personal standard, often delaying progress until each component meets my expectations. Balancing perfectionism with practicality will be essential.
- Business considerations: If the project evolves into a publishable product, I’ll need to consider legal protections such as forming an LLC or similar entity to safeguard intellectual property. If the game is released publicly, I must ensure that the source code is protected and that distribution channels are secure. These considerations introduce complexity beyond typical academic projects.

## Legal Compliance

Legal compliance is a fundamental aspect of any product that interacts with users or enters the public domain. Whether it involves licensing, copyright, data protection, or business registration, there are rules and regulations that must be followed. Understanding these frameworks and ensuring that my project adheres to them will require research and diligence. This legal learning curve is an important part of transitioning from student developer to professional creator.

## Security

Security is another critical concern. Any software that users download or interact with must be designed with safety in mind. It’s essential to ensure that the application does not introduce vulnerabilities—either to my own systems or to the user’s device. This includes:

- Protecting against malicious code
- Securing user data
- Verifying the integrity of third-party libraries and dependencies

## Summary

These professional, legal, and security constraints will shape decisions throughout development. Recognizing them early allows for planning, learning, and mitigation strategies that increase the likelihood of delivering a higher-quality, compliant, and secure final product.
